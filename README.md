Learning Pattern Analysis &amp; Classroom Strategy Insights – Praxis 2.0 Hackathon (DSEU, New Delhi) 
TEAM - Solo (Team Name - EngineerWork)

## Current Status

### Phase 1 – Day 1
- Selected problem statement (PS-4: Learning Patterns & Classroom Strategy Insights)  
- Downloaded and reviewed dataset  
- Created GitHub repository and project structure  

### Phase 2 – Day 2
- Framed ML problem and learning objectives  
- Categorized features based on learning behavior  
- Completed initial data exploration and observations  

### Phase 3 – Day 3
- Data preprocessing and encoding  
- Baseline machine learning models  
- Learning pattern clustering and explainability  
- Strategy recommendation logic  

### Phase 3 – Day 4
- Performed learning pattern discovery using clustering techniques
- Identified meaningful student learning groups based on academic, engagement, and behavioral features
- Added interpretability to explain why students belong to specific learning patterns
- Visualized learning clusters to support classroom-level insights
- Designed initial strategy recommendation logic aligned to identified learning patterns

### Phase 4 -Day 5
 - Added feature importance–based explainability for ML predictions
 - Interpreted learning clusters in teacher-friendly language
 - Designed actionable teaching strategies for each learning pattern
 - Implemented early warning logic for disengagement detection
 - Connected ML outputs to classroom decision-making flow

### Phase 5 - Day 6
- Made a plan to build small dashboard
- Having:
  - Show student data
  - Show learning cluster
  - Show risk level
  - Show teacher recommendation
